## Why CutLab Exists

Most project tools treat video editing like generic task tracking. CutLab is narrower on purpose: projects have clients, due dates, deliverables, review rounds, assets, references, salary batches, and final exports.

CutLab Studio is built around that real production rhythm.

## Product At A Glance

- **Production command center** with compact metrics, workflow charts, deadlines,
  activity, collected earnings, and salary-batch progress.
- **Project operations** with personal and team workspaces, templates, statuses,
  priorities, assignments, due dates, notes, progress, and payout tracking.
- **Client delivery** with client records, secure no-account portals, approved
  downloads, delivery history, and timecoded revision requests.
- **Versioned media library** for deliverables, references, assets, external
  provider links, client visibility, and immutable upload history.
- **Team collaboration** with invitations, roles, assignments, mentions,
  comments, notifications, chat, and a shared activity trail.
- **Reports and payouts** with salary batches, editor totals, date filters,
  paid-state tracking, work-mix charts, and CSV export.
- **Editor identity** with public profiles, selected delivered work, turnaround
  details, portfolio metrics, and separate organization context.
- **Resilient cloud data** through Clerk-authenticated Convex sync with a local
  fallback that can recover when cloud authentication becomes available.

## Latest Product Changes

CutLab now uses a production-operations interface rather than a card-heavy
dashboard. The redesign is shared across Dashboard, Projects, Clients, Library,
Reports, Team, and Settings.

- Rebuilt the shell with grouped navigation, a compact account menu, clearer
  workspace identity, responsive behavior, and consistent light and dark modes.
- Replaced disconnected statistic cards with continuous metric rails, structured
  tables, split workspaces, status chips, and compact operational modules.
- Added real workflow and work-mix visualizations with MUI X Charts.
- Reworked Projects into a focused production index with personal and team views.
- Rebuilt Clients and Library as master-detail workspaces that keep context visible.
- Expanded Reports with salary batch reconciliation, editor payouts, collected
  earnings, period filtering, exports, and visual work distribution.
- Consolidated Settings into an indexed control surface for project rules,
  workflow stages, notifications, permissions, integrations, appearance, and
  regional preferences.
- Improved accessibility for labeled controls and colon-delimited timecode entry.
- Hardened Convex domain values with shared constants, strict validators where
  safe, and legacy normalization so existing records remain readable.
- Improved cloud initialization so a temporary auth failure can render local
  data without preventing a later successful Convex sync.
- Strengthened client-portal ordering, file-version status normalization,
  permission checks, verification scripts, and automated coverage.

## Visual Product Tour

The panels below are art-directed product visuals based on implemented CutLab
workflows. They present the feature story clearly for GitHub; exact interface
details may vary from the running build.

### See The Whole Production Picture

![CutLab Studio command center with project pipeline, deadlines, salary batches, revenue, and activity](assets/readme/command-center.png)

The dashboard brings active work, deadlines, feedback, workflow stages, salary
edit progress, earnings, and recent activity into one operational view.

### Start With An Editing Workflow

![CutLab Studio editing templates for common video production workflows](assets/readme/editing-templates.png)

Eight built-in templates cover YouTube, reels, corporate events, product ads,
weddings, social campaigns, podcasts, and client retainers. Custom templates can
also be saved for recurring workflows. Each template prefills stages,
deliverables, checklists, work type, and expected duration.

### Keep Every Deliverable And Version Traceable

![CutLab Studio project files and immutable video version history](assets/readme/file-versions.png)

Deliverables, references, and assets share one versioned file model with upload
history, provider metadata, client visibility, download controls, and approval
states from Draft through Final Delivered.

### Deliver Through A Secure Client Portal

![CutLab Studio secure portal controls and no-account client delivery experience](assets/readme/client-portal.png)

Editors can publish, disable, expire, regenerate, or password-protect a portal.
Clients see approved files, progress, delivery events, downloads, and timecoded
revision requests without receiving access to internal project data.

### Collaborate Without Mixing Personal And Team Work

![CutLab Studio team workspace with roles, assignments, notifications, comments, and chat](assets/readme/team-collaboration.png)

Owners, Editors, and Reviewers work through server-enforced permissions,
assignments, mentions, timecoded comments, notifications, team chat, and a
shared activity trail while personal projects remain private.

### Track Editing Payouts Without Becoming Accounting Software

![CutLab Studio reports, salary batch ledger, editor payouts, and cloud sync health](assets/readme/reports-payouts.png)

Reports connect delivered projects to salary batches, paid and outstanding
payouts, editor totals, date periods, and CSV exports. Cloud sync health and
local fallback status keep the operating state visible.

### Publish A Professional Editor Profile

![CutLab Studio public editor profile and profile visibility controls](assets/readme/public-profile.png)

Editors can share a public profile with bio, location, timezone, turnaround,
active work, selected delivered projects, and portfolio metrics while private
earnings, notes, references, and team activity stay inside the workspace.

### Keep External Resources Attached To The Project

![CutLab Studio integrations and provider-neutral project resource links](assets/readme/integrations-resources.png)

Google Drive, Dropbox, Slack, and Frame.io connection details and project links
can be organized in CutLab today. Live OAuth, automatic file synchronization,
and message delivery remain explicitly modeled as future integration work. The
[third-party integration review](docs/security/THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATION_REVIEW.md)
defines the trust gate for future OAuth, webhook, accounting, or payment work.

## Data Model Notes

- `projectFiles` represents the logical deliverable, reference, or asset.
- `projectFileVersions` stores each uploaded or linked revision.
- Shared domain constants and Convex validators constrain project, file, provider, role, member, revision, notification, and activity values.
- Legacy values are normalized at read boundaries so stricter validation does not strand existing records.
- Public portal queries return explicit client-safe projections.
- Server authorization always derives from the authenticated Convex identity.
- Team roles gate project and file mutations.
- Deleted projects clean up file versions, client portals, and project activity.

### Upcoming: Cloudflare R2 uploads

Cloudflare R2 support is prepared but intentionally parked. Current project
uploads use Convex Storage. When the R2 feature is released, Convex will remain
the owner of file metadata, authorization, version history, and portal
visibility while R2 stores binary objects behind short-lived signed URLs.

Do not set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=r2` or configure the R2 secrets
yet. The future setup will use `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_REGION`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
`R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `R2_BUCKET` in the Convex deployment environment.

The planned R2 bucket CORS policy is:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://your-cutlab-domain.example"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["Content-Type"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

Existing Convex Storage versions continue to work and are not migrated
automatically. Consider an R2 lifecycle rule for abandoned objects under
`projects/` if users can close the upload dialog after a successful PUT.

More detail lives in [Project File Architecture](docs/architecture/project-file-architecture.md).

## Quality Gates

This branch is validated with TypeScript, Convex tests, team-permission tests, production build checks, route verification, asset verification, and Convex development deployment.

Changes to the Convex-backed Team workspace should pass `npm run verify:team` and a live two-account Clerk/Convex smoke test using the checklist from `npm run verify:team:live`.

Current automated coverage includes:

- Team roles, invitations, project sync, comments, mentions, chat, and role migration.
- Project uploads, external providers, normalized version history, storage uniqueness, portal ordering, privacy, passwords, expiry, and revision limits.
- Local and authenticated cloud project workflows through Playwright.
- Timecode normalization, salary reconciliation, payout calculations, and CSV output through typed application logic.
- Route, link, metadata, screenshot asset, and source-invariant verification across the app.

The Convex-backed Team workspace has a static invariant check with
`npm run verify:team`. Authenticated realtime behavior is covered by the
`npm run verify:team:live` live two-account Clerk/Convex smoke test.

## Current State

CutLab Studio currently includes the redesigned production dashboard, separated
personal and team projects, client management, delivery timeline, calendar,
versioned media library, feedback queue, eight editing templates plus custom reusable templates, project file
and version management, secured client portals, timecoded feedback, team
collaboration, payout reporting, public profiles, indexed settings, responsive
light and dark themes, Clerk authentication, resilient Convex synchronization,
local guest mode, Vercel analytics, and end-to-end workflow coverage.

Client portal security currently includes enable/disable controls, optional expiry, token regeneration, and optional PBKDF2-hashed PIN/password protection. See [Security](docs/security/SECURITY.md) for the storage and access contract.

## Security

CutLab Studio uses Clerk authentication, identity-based Convex authorization, explicit client-safe portal projections, and baseline response headers. See the [Security Policy](docs/security/SECURITY.md) for implementation boundaries and private vulnerability reporting.
