# Access and support

## Purpose
Help people enter the right surface and find policy or support information.

## Anatomy
Access-code form, client portal instructions, contact form, accessibility statement, privacy/terms pages, not-found and error recovery, and support actions.

## Behavior
Preserve access-code entry, token instructions, contact submission, legal aliases/redirects, and recovery links. Keep internal, client, public, and support scopes distinct.

## States
Empty/invalid code, loading, submit success/error, missing route, server error, offline, and unavailable portal.

## Responsive rules
Use centered readable forms and content rails, with no clipped errors or submit actions at 320px or 200% zoom.

## Accessibility
Use semantic main/section landmarks, one h1, associated labels/errors, focus on recovery message, keyboard forms, and readable legal prose.

## Preserved features
`/access`, client portal landing, contact, accessibility, privacy, terms, not-found, and error routes.

## Acceptance checks
Valid/invalid access, contact success/error, legal aliases, recovery links, mobile zoom, keyboard, and screen-reader checks pass.
