# Clients

## Purpose
Keep client identity and project history easy to find.

## Anatomy
Search and add-client action, directory/table, client summary, project history, canonical name display, and open-project action.

## Behavior
Preserve client creation, canonical name matching, history, and project linking from both client and project surfaces.

## States
Loading directory, no clients, no matching query, duplicate/name warning, save error, permission/read-only, and success feedback.

## Responsive rules
Use a compact directory and selected-client sheet on small screens. Keep add and open-project actions visible.

## Accessibility
Use labeled fields, table headers, clear relationship text, keyboard selection, and focus return from forms.

## Preserved features
Client directory, add client, history, matching, and open project.

## Acceptance checks
Create/match/open flows, search, empty/error states, mobile detail, keyboard, contrast, and focus checks pass.
